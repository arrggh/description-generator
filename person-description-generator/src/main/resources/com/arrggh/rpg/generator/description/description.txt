Person Description Generator (${build.number})

Thanks for download this little program of mine. This is a utility I wrote to
quickly generate descriptions and physical characteristics for either PCs or
NPCs for roleplaying.

Currently I have the information for the core races of:
* Shadowrun 3.0
* Dungeons & Dragons 3/3.5.

If you want me to add more please email the info or upload the changes to
github and create a pull request.

Please let me know if you find any bugs or have suggestions to make it
better, just email me.
